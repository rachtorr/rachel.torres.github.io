Hi! I am Rachel, recently became Dr. Torres. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher with a mutli-institutional network working to develop earth and environmental data science curriculum with an Indigenous methods lens. I work in INRSEP+ at Cal-Poly Humboldt. My collaborators are part of the Ecological Forecasting Initiative and the Geoscience Alliance.

**Research**

Received PhD from UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. I worked in the Tague Lab and used the eco-hydrologic model RHESSys.

My dissertation research was in urban eco-hydrology; I am motivated to improve how we can efficiently use water resources and vegetation as green infrastructure to make cities more equitable and sustainable.
